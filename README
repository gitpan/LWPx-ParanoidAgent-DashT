LWPx-ParanoidAgent-DashT version 1.021

This is a module that subclasses LWPx::ParanoidAgent and runs 
in perl's "taint mode" (-T, also -t in 5.8.x versions of Perl).

"The C<LWPx::ParanoidAgent> is a class subclassing C<LWP::UserAgent>,
but paranoid against attackers.  It's to be used when you're fetching
a remote resource on behalf of a possibly malicious user." -- from the 
C<LWPx::ParanoidAgent> documentation.

Unfortunately, it doesn't check the output of the resolver it uses, 
and so leaves the IP address tainted, and it eventually tries to pass
that tainted IP address into C<connect>, whech then fails when used 
with perl's -T option, which is recommended for use when outside data
could be malicious.

This is true even if the address passed in was originally untainted, 
as long as it wasn't an IP address to start with.

This class replaces the _resolve subroutine  of LWPx::ParanoidAgent 
with one that breaks apart the IP address returned and puts it back 
together, therefore untainting it before returning.
